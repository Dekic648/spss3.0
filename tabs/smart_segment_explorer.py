    **What is this?**  
    This tool auto-creates segments like "High" vs. "Low Satisfaction" and runs statistical tests to find meaningful differences across other variables.

    **How to use:**  
    1. Choose a numeric column you'd like to segment  
    2. The app will create two groups and compare them  
    3. You'll see insights where statistically significant differences exist
